# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## This branch is for learning basic of jsx and element create  
`const root=ReactDom.createRoot(getElementById('root'); 
const element=<h1>hello,world<\h1> 
root.render(element)`

### sample to create a functional and class component and pass parameters to component using props
* we are rendering the entire root but only clock element/component gets rendered(function of react vdom)
* we created 2 components: 
    1. function component in which we pass name as prop
    2. class component in which we pass date as prop

### this is compose-extract component example 
* "Comment" component has following child element which we will split into different components
    * UserInfo: Avatar(image) and UserInfo-name
    * comment-text
    * comment-date
* in this branch we have one "Comment.js" component which has all element which we will split in next sub-branch

### this is extraction of component example
* from above info we have extraction the userInfo with further extraction of avatar component.
